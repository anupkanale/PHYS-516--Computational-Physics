\section{Part I- Stock price simulation}
This section illustrates the application of MC simulation to a stochastic problem-- Stock price in this case specifically.

\subsection{MC simulations of stock price based on Black-Scholes Model}	
A program was written in C to perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a stock price, $S$, as a function of time, $t$, assuming that $S$ follows a discrete stochastic equation
	\begin{equation}
		dS = \mu S dt + \sigma \varepsilon S \sqrt{dt}
	\end{equation}
where $dt$ is the time discretization unit and $\varepsilon$ is a random variable following the normal distribution with unit variance. The code is attached in the appendix at the end of the report.

\subsection{Temporal variation of stock price}
A simulation was run to see the variation of stock price over time. There are 100 random walker (or investors), the starting stock price was chosen as $\$20.0$ and a $14 \%$ per annum ($\mu = 0.14$) expected return with a standard deviation of $20\%$ per annum ($\sigma = 0.20$) was used. Let $dt = 0.00274 year (~1 day)$. The MC simulation was run for $1 year (365 steps)$.

The variation of the stock price is as shown in the plot

	\end{figure}
The matlab script for plotting is included in the Appendix.

\subsection{Histogram of stock price}
The MC simulations were repeated 1,000 times with the same parameters, but with different randomnumber seeds. The histogram below shows the number of random walkers (or investors) at each given price of stock at the end of the year.
