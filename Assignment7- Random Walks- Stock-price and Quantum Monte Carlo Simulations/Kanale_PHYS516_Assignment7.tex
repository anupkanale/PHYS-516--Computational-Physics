\section{\vspace{-1ex}Stock price simulation}
This section illustrates the application of MC simulation to a stochastic problem-- Stock price in this case specifically. \vspace{-2ex}

\subsection{\vspace{-2ex} MC simulations of stock price based on Black-Scholes Model}	
A program was written in C to perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a stock price, $S$, as a function of time, $t$, assuming that $S$ follows a discrete stochastic equation
	\begin{equation}
		dS = \mu S dt + \sigma \varepsilon S \sqrt{dt}
	\end{equation}
where $dt$ is the time discretization unit and $\varepsilon$ is a random variable following the normal distribution with unit variance. The code is attached in the appendix at the end of the report.\vspace{-2ex}

\subsection{\vspace{-2ex} Temporal variation of stock price}
A simulation was run to see the variation of stock price over time. There are 100 random walker (or investors), the starting stock price was chosen as \$20.0 and a 14 \% per annum ($\mu = 0.14$) expected return with a standard deviation of 20\% per annum ($\sigma = 0.20$) was used. Let dt = 0.00274 year (~1 day). The MC simulation was run for 1 year (365 steps).

The variation of the stock price is as shown in figure \ref{stock}. The matlab script for plotting is included in the Appendix.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{stockPricePlot.jpg}
	\caption{Variation of stock price over the year for 1000 investors}
	\end{figure}

\subsection{\vspace{-2ex} Histogram of stock price}
The MC simulations were repeated 1,000 times with the same parameters, but with different random number seeds. The histogram below in figure \ref{hist} shows the number of random walkers (or investors) at each given price of stock at the end of the year.
	\begin{figure}[!htbp] \label{hist}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{stockHistogram.jpg}
	\caption{Histogram at the end of the year for 1000 investors}
	\end{figure}

As the number of investors is increased, the histogram gradually becomes a smooth Gaussian, as is seen from figure \ref{increase}

\section{\vspace{-1ex}Quantum Monte Carlo simulation}
This section illustrates the quantum Monte Carlo technique. The difference from Part I is that while simulating the electron wave function, in addition to the diffusion term, a birth/death term exists in the Imaginary-time Schrodinger Equation. \vspace{-2ex}

\subsection{\vspace{-2ex} Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of 1D Diffusion problem}
A program was written to simulate diffusion using quantum Monte Carlo simulation of a 1D electron wave function, in a harmonic potential given by $V(x) = x^2/2$ (in the atomic unit). The program is attached in appendix A. The energy as a function of MC steps is shown in figure \ref{energy}

	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{energyVariation.jpg}
	\caption{Energy variation with MC step}
	\end{figure} \vspace{-2ex}
	
\subsection{\vspace{-2ex} Histogram}
The histogram of random walkers is shown in figure \ref{qmc}
	\begin{figure}[!htbp] \label{qmc}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{qmcHistogram.jpg}
	\caption{Histogram of random walkers}
